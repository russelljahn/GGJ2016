INTRO
The development of Smart TVs had unintended consequences... including Smart Pixels.

Smart Pixels developed a community, and with it, their own rituals.

Pixels which were near death were tasked with a pilgrimage, to find a place in The World Beyond the Screen.

This is the story of one pixel's journey.






OUTRO
So next time a pixel dies on the TV that spies on you, remember...

Somewhere, a new cat came into the world.

THE END.
